                    <p>Inspired by the introduction of computer programming to the curriculum I retrained as a computer science teacher after a twenty-five-year career as a software engineer in industry.
                        I aim to develop students into strong programmers with the vision to see clearly where computers can help to provide solutions to the problems of our age. Along the way students develop an appreciation of the astonishing potential of computers to reshape the future, a vision I hope they take with them into their adult lives.</p>
                    <p>I am a qualified Computer Science teacher currently working at a Further Education college in West Sussex. I teach AQA A-level Computer Science, primarily using C#, C, SQL, and Haskell, but I also have experience teaching Python and other programming languages. Additionally, I have taught GCSE Computer Science in a secondary school, following the OCR specification.</p>
