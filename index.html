                    <p><i>Inspired by the introduction of computer programming to the curriculum I retrained as a computer science teacher after a 
                        twenty-five-year career as a software engineer in industry. I aim to develop students into strong programmers with the 
                        vision to see clearly where computers can help to provide solutions to the problems of our age. Along the way students 
                        develop an appreciation of the astonishing potential of computers to reshape the future, a vision I hope they take with 
                        them into their adult lives.</i></p>
